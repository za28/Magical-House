You are in a Magical House where each room is a different country. The Magical House consists of 6 rooms: Japan, Italy, Mexico, India, Spain and a special Portal room that transports you to a random room in the house. Your mission is to go home. In order to go home, you must visit all the countries in this house and collect the traditional food of that country. You can carry the food items in your bag but you can’t carry all the items, so first you must find and gain power in order to increase the total weight that you can carry. Also, remember that you can only carry food items and you can’t carry random objects. There are 2 characters in this game: a fairy and a dragon. The fairy accompanies you on your mission and you can ask the fairy for clues. Whereas the dragon appears in rooms randomly. If you run into the dragon on your mission, you can ask the dragon for a fact about the country that you are in. Once you have collected the traditional food from each country and gone home, you have completed the mission. However, if you fail to take all the correct items then you will not be able to go home and you will not be able to complete the mission.

The game has 7 classes: Game, Room, Command, CommandWords, Parser, Player and Character. To play the game you create a Game object and call the Play() method on it. This method contains the main command loop it reads and executes commands until the game is over.  The Parser reads the users input and the Game tries to evaluate these commands. The player class represents a player in the game and the character class represents a character in the game. The player and character are initialised and created in the Game class. The rooms are also initialised and created in the Game class. Items are added to the rooms. For the game to end the loop condition of the main loop in the play() method must become false.

In my game the portal room doesn’t hold any items but is able to hold items. All the other rooms hold 3-4 items to begin with. The items are put into the rooms when the createRooms method of the Game class is called. 3 items are added to all the room apart from the portal room, using the addItems method of the Room class. The power item is put into one of the rooms at random. 
I have a “take” command which allows the user to take items from rooms and put them in their bag. In my game the player can only take food items so the player cannot take items such as “shoe” and “crayon”. The player can only take items from the current room that they are in. when the user inputs “take sushi” the takeItem methos of the Game class is called. The item is added to the players bag by calling the addItemToBag method on the player and passing in the items name and weight as parameters. The item is then removed from the current room by calling the removeItem method on the currentRoom and passing in the name of the item as a parameter. The player cannot carry any more items once their bag is full, so the take method also checks if the players bag is full by calling the bagFull method on the player. If the players bag is full, they are not able to take any more items.
However, the player can take more items if they return some items first. I also have a “return” method which allows the player to return items from their bag to rooms. The player can only return items to the current room that they are in and the player can only return the items that are in their bag.
So, the player can move items from one room to another and the number of items in each room changes during the game.

In my game the items are stored in a HashMap, the Key is a String and is the name of the item and the Value is an int and is the weight of the item. The player can carry items in their bag. The player can only carry a total weight of 30, but once they find and gain the power, they can carry a total weight of 50. They cannot carry any more than this. Every time the player tries to take an item the take method of the Game class is called. This method checks if the players bag is full by calling the isFull method on the player. This method returns true if the total weight of all the items in the bag is greater than or equal to the maximum weight that the player can carry. And the method returns false if the total weight of items is less than the maximum weight that the player can carry. If the method returns true that player is not able to take any more items, however, is the method returns false the player is able to take another item. The take method calls the addItemToBag method on the player to add items to the player’s bag. The player can return items to reduce the total weight of all the items in the bag, in this case the player will be able to take more items until the bag is full again. 

In my game the players mission is to go home and in order to go home the player must visit each room and take the traditional food from that country. If the user inputs “go home”, the goHome method of the game class is called. This method calls the hasWon method of the player clas son the playes. This hasWon method checks if the player has all the correct traditional food items from each country in their bag. If the player has all the correct items the hasWon method returns true, otherwise it returns false. It the hasWon method returns true the gpHome method outputs a message informing the user that they have won the game. The goHome method returns a true signal to the hasWon boolean in the processCommand method, this methos then returns a true signal to the finishes boolean in the play method of the game class. This causes the loop condition to become false so the loop terminates and the game ends.  If the hasWon method returns false the goHome method outputs a message to the user informing them that they have not won the game yet.

I added 6 new command words: 
“back” – takes the player back to the previous room that they were in. 
“take” – allows the player to take items from rooms and carry them in their bag.
“return” – allows the player to return items from their bag to the rooms.
“ask” – allows the player to ask the characters for clues or facts.
“directions” – shows directions to all other rooms from the current room that the player is in.
“map” – shows the player a map of the game.

I added a Character class. This class has a currentRoom field of type Room that stores the current room that the character is in. it also has a HashMap called speeches which had a Key of type Room which is the room that the character says this speech in. And it has a String Value which is the speech that a character says in a given room. I have 2 characters in my game, a fairy and a dragon. They are created in the Game class. They both move every time the player moves. The fairy follows the player around while the dragon appears in random rooms. Since my characters both have different movement, I have a changeFairyRoom method and a changeDragonRoom method in my Game class. Both methods are called every time the player changes room.

I extended the getCommand method of the Parser class to also get the third word of the command and to create a 3-word Command. The Command class now has a thirdWord field in its constructor so when a Command is created it is created with 3 words. I also added a getThirsWord method to the Command class which returns the third word of the command and a hasThirdWord method which checks if the command has a third word. These methods can be called on commands in the Game class to help the game class execute the commands the user inputs. The player can ask the fairy for clue by inputting “ask fairy clue” and ask the dragon for facts by inputting “ask dragon fact”. The dragon says facts about each room and the fairy gives clues about which item the user needs to take from each room. 

I have added a Portal room to my game. Whenever a player enters this room the portal method of the Game class is called. This method calls the getRandomRoom method of the Game class to generate a random room. Then the portal method changes the players room to this randomly generated room.

I used a stack to store the previous rooms of the player. Every time the player moves into a new room, the previous room is Pushed onto the stack. When the user inputs “back”, the back method of the Game class is called. This method Pops the previous room if the player of the stack and the previous room becomes the current room. The player can reach the room that they started the game in by entering the back command multiple times.

If the user inputs “bag”, the bag methos of the Game class is called. This method calls the getBagStringLong method on the player which returns a String of all the items in the players bag and the total weight of all the items. This string is then outputted to the user by the bag method of the Game class.

A power item is added to a random room in the createRooms method of the Game class. The getRandomRoom method in the Game class is used to get a random room and the addItem method in the Room class is called to add the item to this random room. I have added a “gain” command which allows the player to gain power when they are in the room that contains this item. If the player has found the room that contains this power item, they can input “gain power” and the power item will be removed from the current room by calling the removeItem method of the Room class on the current room that the player is in and passing in “power” as the parameter. Then the total weight that the player can carry will be increased by calling the increaseMaxWeight method of the Player class on the player. This method increases the weight that the player can carry by 20.

If the user inputs “map”, the map method in the Game class prints out a string which resembles a map of the Magical House.

If the user inputs “directions”, the printDirections method in the Game class prints out the directions to all the other rooms from the current room that the player is in. The directions from a room to all other rooms in the house are declared in the createRooms method in the Game class.
